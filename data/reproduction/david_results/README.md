# Mock DAVID Enrichment Results

This directory contains synthetic datasets (`mock_david_*.csv`) designed strictly for pipeline validation and testing of the Figure 4 reproduction workflow.

### WARNING
- **NON-BIOLOGICAL DATA**: These files do not represent real experimental results.
- **USAGE**: Provided ONLY for code verification and demonstration.
- **PROHIBITION**: Do NOT use these files for biological interpretation, comparative studies, or scientific publication.

The use of mock data ensures the confirmatory analysis logic (Figure 4) can be reviewed and tested without reliance on external manual downloads during development.
